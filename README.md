# Employee Background Verification Service
This is a web app that serves as an employee background verification service, which will have both employees and recruiters as users. In this site, users can put all their previous work experience with details like duration of their work, company name, and their designation in that company. When they claim their experience, it notifies the company through our dashboard, saying person with so and so details claims to have worked in your company, so they will have the option to tag if that claim is true, by choosing the provided options as Verify, Absconded, Reject. This idea can even be expanded to companies searching for specific employee and adding a tag of their position and role in their company.
